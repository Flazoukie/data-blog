## About This Blog

Welcome to my blog! Here is where I share my journey in data science through hands-on projects, tutorials, and reflections.
I hope you'll find something useful, inspiring, or entertaining for you here.

## About Me

My name is Flavia and I am currently a data scientist based in Hamburg, Germany.
I also have a PhD in philosophy and research experience in empirical psychology. Both taught me useful skills that now I like to apply outside academia.
I'm also a Brazilian Zouk dance teacher and event organizer. If you are curious about my dance life, you can visit [Share Zouk Hamburg](https://sharezoukhamburg.de).

This blog brings together my curiosity, creativity, and desire to share knowledge. Thanks for visiting!
