## Introduction

Creating your own blog is a great way to share your data projects. With **[Quarto](https://quarto.org)** and **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**, you can easily publish a professional-looking blog for free, using simple Markdown and code.

This setup is ideal for:

* Showcasing data science or programming projects
* Writing technical tutorials (like this ;) )
* Maintaining a lightweight, fast, and version-controlled website

In this tutorial, I’ll walk you through how to create your blog step by step using Quarto and GitHub Pages.

## 🧰 What You’ll Need

### Technical Requirements

1. **Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)**
   Quarto is the publishing engine. You can write in Markdown, embed code, and produce beautiful web pages, a great thing about Quarto is that it supports various languages like R, Python, Julia, and Observable JavaScript. Download and install it from the official site.

2. **Create a GitHub account** (if you don’t have one yet)
   You'll use GitHub to host your website for free via GitHub Pages.

3. **Install Git** (if not already installed)
   Quarto uses Git to publish your site to GitHub. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and set it up locally.

> _Optional but helpful_: A code editor like VS Code or PyCharm makes writing `.qmd` files easier, but it’s not required. I am personally using PyCharm Community Edition (the free version fo PyCharm) [Download PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows).

## 🚀 Step-by-Step: Create Your Blog

We’ll now create and publish your blog in just a few steps.

---

### 1. Create a New Quarto Website

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
quarto create-project my-blog --type website
cd my-blog
```

This creates a new folder called "my-blog" with the basic structure of a Quarto website. You can rename my-blog to whatever you want.

### 2. Preview Your Website Locally

To check if everything worked correctly, run the following command to see your site in your browser:

```bash
quarto preview
```

This launches a localhost preview.
Any time you change a .qmd file and save it, the preview updates automatically.
Remember, this is not your site yet, but just a local preview. Next I will guide you through creating a proper site using GitHub Pages.

### 3. Configure the Site for GitHub Pages

To publish your site using GitHub Pages, you need to configure Quarto to render your output into a folder named docs/.

In the root of your project, open the _quarto.yml file and modify or add the following line:

```yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```
Then render your site:

```bash
quarto render
```
Quarto will generate the site in a docs/ folder, which GitHub Pages can use for publishing.

### 4. Push Your Site to GitHub

Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., "my-blog")

Initialize Git and link your local project to your GitHub repo:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-blog.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

Don't forget to replace "yourusername" with your actual username and "my-blog" with your actual blog name ;).
🔐 If you're using HTTPS, GitHub will ask you for a token instead of a password. You can generate one here.


### 5. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository

2. Click on Settings → Pages

3. Under Source, select:

* Branch: main

* Folder: /docs

Click Save. After a few seconds, your site will be live at:
https://yourusername.github.io/data-blog/

> _Note:_:This is the path I chose to publish my blog, however there are alternative ways to do it, which may better satisfy your requirements, have a look here:
[GitHub Pages for Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#render-to-docs).

## ✍🏿 Create Your First Blog Post

If you do not have a folder for your posts already, create a new one. I keep my posts inside the folder "posts", within my own project folder DataBlog.
Now you can create a new file, which will become your first post. For example:

```bash
posts/how-to-create-a-data-blog.qmd
```

You can start with this header and modify it accordingly with your needs:

```yaml
---
title: "How to Create a Data Blog Using Quarto"
date: 2025-05-11
categories: [tutorial, quarto, github, blogging]
format:
  html:
    toc: true
    code-tools: true
    theme: cosmo
---
```

Then write your content below using Markdown and code blocks as needed.

When ready, render the site again:

```bash
quarto render
```

Now push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add first blog post"
git push
```

Visit your blog again — Congratulations, your new post is live! ✌🏿
