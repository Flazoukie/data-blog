Welcome to my first blog post! In this tutorial, I’ll walk you through how I created this data blog using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## What You’ll Need

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/download/)
- A GitHub account and basic familiarity with Git

I used PyCharm

## Steps Overview

1. **Create a Quarto website:**
   ```bash
   quarto create-project myblog --type website
